# Music Player Project


## Overview
Welcome to the Music Player Project! This project is a simple project in order to familiaze myself with basic concepts of HTML,CSS and REACT. More specifically, this project provides a interface with which a user can interact so that they can listen to their favourite music piece. 

At this moment, although buttons for selecting the previous/next track, repeating current track and listening to a random order songs are displayed, they don't provide any functionality yet.

## Feautures
**A rotating picture:** A picture that resembles a vinyl record which rotates when the song plays.
**Play/Pause Button:** Easily play or pause your music with a single click.
**Progress Bar:** Watch the progress bar move as the track plays.Click on any point in the progress bar to jump to a specific part of the track.
**Track Position:** The duration and progress of the music is displayed in minutes.

## Improvement:
I am continually working to enhance the Music Player Project. Here are some planned improvements and features I aim to implement in future updates:

1.**Functionaly to buttons:** Actions for the "Next" and "Previous" track, "Repeat" track and "Random" track buttons to allow users to navigate through their playlist smoothly.
2.**Creation of a playlist**
3.**Volume Control**
4.**Song Description**
5.**Filters such as reverb, bass boost etc.**
