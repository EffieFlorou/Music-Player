# Music Player Project


## Overview
Welcome to the Music Player Project! This project is a simple project in order to familiaze myself with basic concepts of HTML,CSS and REACT. More specifically, this project provides a interface with which a user can interact so that they can listen to their favourite music piece. 

At this moment, although buttons for selecting the previous/next track, repeating current track and listening to a random order songs are displayed, they don't provide any functionality yet.


## Feautures
- **A rotating picture:** A picture that resembles a vinyl record which rotates when the song plays.

- **Play/Pause Button:** Easily play or pause your music with a single click.

- **Progress Bar:** Watch the progress bar move as the track plays.Click on any point in the progress bar to jump to a specific part of the track.

- **Track Position:** The duration and progress of the music is displayed in minutes.

## Improvement:
I am continually working to enhance the Music Player Project. Here are some planned improvements and features I aim to implement in future updates:

- **Functionaly to buttons:** Actions for the "Next" and "Previous" track, "Repeat" track and "Random" track buttons to allow users to navigate through their playlist smoothly.

- **Creation of a playlist**

- **Volume Control**

- **Song Description**

- **Filters such as reverb, bass boost etc.**

## Tools and Technologies Used

This project is built using **Vite** and **React**.

- **Vite:** A fast build tool that provides a modern development experience.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

To get started with this project, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run the following commands:

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install
