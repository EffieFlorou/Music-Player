# Music Player Project


## Overview
Welcome to the Music Player Project! This project is a simple project designed to help me
familiarize myself with the basic concepts of HTML, CSS, and React. More specifically, 
this project provides an interface with which users can interact so that they can listen to their favourite music. 

Although buttons for selecting the previous/next track, repeating the current track, and listening to songs in random order are displayed, they don't provide any functionality yet.


## Features
- **A rotating picture:** A picture that resembles a vinyl record that rotates when the song plays.

- **Play/Pause Button:** Easily play or pause your music with a single click.

- **Progress Bar:** Watch the progress bar move as the track plays. Click on any point in the progress bar to jump to a specific part of the track.

- **Track Position:** The duration and progress of the music is displayed in minutes.

## Improvement:
I am continually working to enhance the Music Player Project. Here are some planned improvements and features I aim to implement in future updates:

- **Functionality to buttons:** Actions for the "Next" and "Previous" track, "Repeat" track and "Random" track buttons to allow users to navigate through their playlist smoothly.

- **Creation of a playlist**

- **Volume Control**

- **Song Description**

- **Filters such as reverb, bass boost, etc.**

## Tools and Technologies Used

This project is built using **Vite** and **React**.

- **Vite:** A fast-build tool that provides a modern development experience.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

To get started with this project, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run the following commands:

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```
